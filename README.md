# Project 1 - tipCalculator

tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Shea Ketsdever

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories - test

The following required functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Aesthetically improved the UI
- [x] Created a settings page and tried to use it to update the default tip percentage (not complete yet)
- [x] Added information on splitting the total bill among different sizes of groups

## Notes

I spent a lot of unnecessary time implementing a sliding tip bar becasue I thought it would be necessary for the rest of the optionals. This meant I didn't have enough time to actually explore the more complicated optional features even though I finished the basic app early in the day.
